# CraftedSpecially Constitution



## Core Principles

### I. Architecture-First (ARC42)
All features and services MUST be documented in the Docs/Architecture folder using the ARC42 standard. All architecture diagrams MUST be created with Mermaid. Documentation MUST be kept up to date with implementation.
Rationale: Ensures clarity, maintainability, and onboarding for all contributors.

### II. Feature Slices (API & Implementation)
All APIs, services, and supporting code MUST be organized and implemented as feature slices. Each feature slice encapsulates all related logic, data, and endpoints for a specific business capability, minimizing cross-feature dependencies. Shared code is extracted only when justified by repeated use across multiple slices.
Rationale: Promotes modularity, scalability, and clear ownership of features.

### III. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All new code MUST be developed using TDD. Tests MUST be written and fail before implementation. Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. No code is merged without passing tests.
Rationale: Guarantees reliability and enables safe refactoring.

### IV. Simplicity and Modularity
Code and architecture MUST be as simple as possible. Each module/service MUST have a clear, single responsibility. Avoid overengineering and unnecessary dependencies.
Rationale: Reduces maintenance burden and increases agility.

### V. Observability and Traceability
All services MUST provide structured logging, metrics, and traceability for debugging and monitoring. All changes MUST be traceable to a documented requirement or issue.
Rationale: Enables rapid diagnosis and compliance.



## Additional Constraints

- All architecture documentation MUST follow ARC42 structure.
- All diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax.
- Technology stack decisions MUST be documented and justified in architecture docs.
- Security and compliance requirements MUST be explicitly listed and reviewed for every release.
- Performance standards MUST be defined and validated for each service.
- All APIs and implementations MUST adhere to the feature slice architecture, with clear boundaries and minimal cross-slice dependencies.


## Development Workflow

- All features begin with a documented specification and plan.
- Code reviews MUST verify compliance with all principles and constraints.
- No code is merged without passing all required tests and validation gates.
- All changes MUST be linked to a tracked issue or feature request.
- Documentation MUST be updated as part of every change.


## Governance

- This constitution supersedes all other project practices and policies.
- Amendments require a documented proposal, review, and approval by project maintainers.
- All amendments MUST include a migration plan and update all dependent templates and documentation.
- Constitution version MUST increment according to semantic versioning:
	- MAJOR: Backward-incompatible changes or removals.
	- MINOR: New principles or sections, or expanded guidance.
	- PATCH: Clarifications, typo fixes, or non-semantic refinements.
- Compliance is reviewed at every major release and before merging significant changes.
- For runtime development guidance, refer to Docs/Architecture and README.md.
