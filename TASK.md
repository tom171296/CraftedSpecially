# Feature: List Available Brews

As a CraftedSpecially enjoyer,
I want to have a pipeline
so that I can build the catalog service with the best security best practices.

## Examples

- A GitHub Actions workflow is created for the Catalog service.
- The workflow includes steps for:
  - Restoring dependencies
  - Building the project
  - Running unit tests (using MSTest)
  - Performing static code analysis and security scanning (e.g., CodeQL)
  - Checking for vulnerable dependencies (e.g., using Dependabot or dotnet list package --vulnerable)
  - Publishing build artifacts
  - Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using secure credentials
- Secrets and credentials are stored securely using GitHub Secrets.
- The workflow uses the principle of least privilege for permissions.
- The workflow is configured to prevent secrets from leaking in logs.
- The workflow is triggered on pull requests and pushes to main branches.
- The workflow fails if any security or test step fails.

## Edge Cases

- Edge case: Build or test fails—pipeline stops and notifies maintainers.
- Edge case: Security scan finds vulnerabilities—pipeline fails and reports details.
- Failure case: Deployment to AKS fails—pipeline stops and provides error output.

## Documentation

- Architecture documentation will be added in `docs/architecture` following the ARC42 template:
  - Building Blocks View: Document the Catalog service and its API for listing brews.
  - Runtime View: Document the flow from user request to response, including error handling.
  - Glossary: Add terms such as "brew", "catalog", and "order".

## Other considerations

None.
